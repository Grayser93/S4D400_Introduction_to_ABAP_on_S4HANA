"A subroutine is a reusable section of code. itab is like a mini-program that can be called from another point in your program. Within itab you can define variables, execute statements, compute results, and write output. To define a subroutine, use the f
"orm
"statement to indicate the start of a subroutine, and use endform to indicate the end of the subroutine. The name of a subroutine cannot exceed 30 characters.
"Defining and Calling a Subroutine

 write: / 'Before call 1'.
 perform sub1.
 write: / 'Before call 2'.
 perform sub1.
 write: / 'After calls'.

 form sub1.
   write: / 'Inside sub1'.
 endform.



"Passing Parameters to a Subroutine


* data: f1 value 'A',
*       f2 value 'B',
*       f3 value 'C'.
*
* perform: s1 using f1 f2 f3,
*          s2 using f1 f2 f3.
*
* form s1 using p1 p2 p3.
*    write: / f1, f2, f3,
*           / p1, p2, p3.
* endform.
*
*form s2 using f1 f2 f3.
*    skip.
*    write: / f1, f2, f3.
*endform.


"Pass by value and by reference


* data: f1 value 'A',
*       f2 value 'B'.
*
* write: / f1, f2.
* perform s1 using f1 f2.
* write: / f1, f2.
*
*form s1 using p1
*              value(p2).
*    p1 = p2 = 'X'.
*endform.


"How to Pass an Internal Table Without a Header Line to a Subroutine


" Here, an internal table that doesn't have a header line
" is passed without creating a header line automatically

* data: itab type table of snwd_bpa.         "doesn't have a header line
*
* select * up to 5 rows from snwd_bpa into table itab
* order by bp_id.
* perform: s1 using itab,

*         s3 using itab,
